I was really interested in Data Science. But I really didn't have much idea about Enterprise reporting or analysis. But this book gives much more than Microsoft SQL Server BI tool (Business Intelligence). It helped me to learn basics, some of the theories about Data Warehousing. Because I learned things from scratch, I think this is good for beginners. But you have to have a little bit of SQL Server exposure before. <br /><br />This is not just an exam prep. This is something more than that. You can learn for an exam as well. If you love to start learning Data warehousing with SQL Server, you can go with this book. This book gives you a good start for sure. I love Microsoft Press exam training kits because they have nice questions and explained answers which you can measure yourself.<br /><br />This book is available as ePub, Mobi, PDF. So you can think about purchasing an ebook also.<br /><br />You can buy this book from here:&nbsp;<strong style="background-color: #f7fcff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18.140625px;"><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145345219.do">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145345219.do</a></strong><br /><strong style="background-color: #f7fcff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18.140625px;"><br /></strong></div>
