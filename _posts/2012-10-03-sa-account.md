title: "SA Account"
---

As I read after installing SQL Server on a System it is a best practice to disable SA account. Then I asked our architect, and one of prod DBAs. Then I got to know Yes it is a good practice if you disable SA Account because it is a well-known account. And also we can rename that account then there is no point to disable it.

Somehow finally I got to know that nobody should use SA account.
