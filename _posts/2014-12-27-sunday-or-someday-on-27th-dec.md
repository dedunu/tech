Three of us wanted to go somewhere. Then we tried to pick a date, but we couldn't. Finally, we just agreed to go out on Sunday. We went to [Lavinia Breeze](http://www.laviniabreeze.lk/) and had fun. Screaming, Laughing. We don't mind what others think. That's us!!!

Then we went to Majestic City Cinema to watch Hobbit. And we laughed like idiots when everyone wants us to be serious. ;) Ended up in [Elite Indian Restaurant](http://www.yamu.lk/place/elite-indian-restaurant/).
