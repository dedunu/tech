I was really interested in reading this book. But it took a long time to me to read it. And the concepts which are explained in this book are really important. To a person who wants to start learning about Big data concepts, I will recommend this book for sure.

If you have prior knowledge of BI tools and techniques, this book will help you to learn help you to quicker than any other book in the market. And this book won't get outdated like a technology book.  Because these concepts are valid for anything you are going to do.

I am working with Big Data researchers as part of my job. So I found this book was very helpful to learn Big data concepts and that made my life easier.

I like this book and I will recommend to anyone who wants to learn about Big data concepts. No matter whether they are students/novice or intermediate readers.
