title: "Are you fed up with Outlook Express"
---

As usual most of us are using web-based emails such as Yahoo, G mail or Hotmail. Almost no one uses email client software like Outlook Express or Outlook. Every time we click on an email link it opens Outlook and ask us to configure the email account.

If you are using FireFox we can say bye to our email client software.

Get options dialog box from `Firefox Tools -> Options` for Windows XP.

Then Click on the Application tab.

Then find "`mailto`". You can see the drop down box in front of it. Change it to Use Gmail or Use Yahoo. If you are not using Gmail or Yahoo you can configure your web-based email client.
