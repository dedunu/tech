title: "Fixing boot loop in Xiaomi Redmi Note 7"
---

I bought a Xiaomi [Redmi Note 7](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_7-9513.php) with MIUI Version: 10.3.5. I was not very happy with the preinstalled apps. So I tried to remove them using "`adb`". I accidentally deleted some app  I shouldn't delete.

Everything was fine until I restart the device. When I restarted it, it was caught in a boot loop. I had to find a way to fix my phone.

> **Warning: IF YOU FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR DATA!**

I repeat again this will wipe all your data. Luckily everything was backed up in my mobile. There was nothing I couldn't recover.

1. Press the volume up button and power button together for a few seconds.

2. It will boot up to the recovery menu.

3. You can navigate using volume up and down buttons. Press the volume down button to select "`Wipe Data`". Press the power button.

4. Press the power button again. Then select the "`Confirm`" option and press the power button again

5. Now we need to reboot back to the system. Select the "`Reboot`" option and press the power button.

It may take a while to start the phone. Now all your data is wiped and the system is restored. Now you have to log in and set up!
