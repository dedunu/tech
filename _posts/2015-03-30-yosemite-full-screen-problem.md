title: Yosemite Full Screen problem :(
---

People hate Yosemite. But I don't know why. I like Yosemite more than Mavericks. But Yosemite has a problem with Maximize button. (Zoom) As you click Zoom or maximize button it will go to full-screen mode.

To avoid this press zoom while you are pressing `Option` (key).

If you want to maximize Chrome click zoom while you are pressing `Option + Shift`
