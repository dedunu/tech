If you have so many documents in your collection in MongoDB database. Sometimes you may want to retrieve a few documents. But if we run find() we can't have nice output. You may need to have a nice indentation and line breaks. You may want results in a more readable way. Then you can use pretty().

If you use `pretty()` you can take nice output with Mongo Shell.
