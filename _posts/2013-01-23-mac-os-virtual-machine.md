title: Mac OS Virtual Machine
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div align="justify">For a long time, I was suffering because I wanted to use Mac OS. But I didn’t have any apple computer to use it. Also, I didn’t try to install Mac OS to Virtual Machine. But after joining Pearson I saw few Apple machines daily. And my eager to use Mac OS got exponentially increased. Then I started to think about Mac OS Virtual Machine. I had downloaded a genuine Mac OS installation long ago. But it was not a good one to install Mac OS to Virtual. So then I found this article.</div><a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/07/mountain-lion-virtualbox.html" title="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/07/mountain-lion-virtualbox.html">http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/07/mountain-lion-virtualbox.html</a><br /><div align="justify">And I tried with its instruction in a little bit different way. I used Ubuntu 12.10 as a host operating system. My computer had a Core i7 processor with DH67CL motherboard. So I was able to successfully install and run Mac OS Mountain Lion as a Virtual Machine on Ubuntu 12.10 with Oracle VirtualBox.</div></div>
