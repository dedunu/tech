title: Nokia 4.2 Review
---

I recently bought a [Nokia 4.2 32GB/3GB phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_4_2-9603.php). I am quite happy with it. But I wanted to write down the pros and cons of the device. I bought this device three months ago. It costs me around 120 EUR/130 USD. Prior to this, I used an Xiaomi Redmi Note 7. I was never happy with the software. It was bloated with so many applications I didn't use.

I love the software runs on Nokia 4.2. When I bought the phone it was running Android 9. Last week I got an Android 10 update too!

I like the size of the phone, very similar to iPhone 5S/SE dimensions. It is easy to handle and type with one hand. Since this is an Android One device, it is tightly connected to Google ecosystem. This is the first Android phone I started to like. But there are a few problems. The wifi module doesn't support 5Ghz access points. Moreover, this has a mini USB port. (Almost every other phone has USB-C). Speakers are not high quality. The camera is not that good. You can't remove Google search box on the desktop. I'm not quite happy about that.

Battery life is quite good. It lasts 1-2 days with moderate use. I am on wifi most of the times. The operating system is clutter-free. Almost no bloatware. HMD Global issues security patches frequently. Even though this phone has NFC, Google Pay is not available in Estonia. Amazing integration with Google assistant. When I turn off the alarm, it can trigger my morning routine. A routine can tell you about the weather, commute, news and many more. It is a dual sim phone and has a slot for microSD card too. You can use both SIMs and microSD card at the same time.
