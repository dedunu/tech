title: "Hisense TV says File Format Not Supported"
---

I bought a Hisense TV recently. I used it to watch a couple of downloaded movies. After a couple of weeks, the same files stopped working. TV showed an error message. I tried to find help online. It was not that helpful. I found out that clearing the cache fixed the issue.

### How to clear cache?

1. Open the settings menu.
2. Select `Settings` option.
3. Select `System` option.
4. Select `Application Settings` option.
5. Select `Clear Cache`.
6. Select and press "Clear" button.

The TV will restart after that.
