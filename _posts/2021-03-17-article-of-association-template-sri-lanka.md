title: "Article of Association Template for Sri Lankan Private Limited Companies"
---

Recently, I registered a private limited company in Sri Lanka. My experience was surprisingly smooth. I could do all the paperwork online. Almost all the documents are generated via the online system called EROC. Payments can be done by cards too.

They have given a detailed guide too. But drafting the article of association wasn't that straightforward. Some guidelines can be found [here](http://www.drc.gov.lk/en/?page_id=2741).

I prepared a template for anyone else to use. It can be downloaded from [here](../resources/Sri_Lanka_Private_Limited_Company_Article_of_Association_Template.zip)

Make sure you leave enough free space on the first page of the article of association, officers want to add few lines of system-generated information. Maximum file size allowed is 4MB.
