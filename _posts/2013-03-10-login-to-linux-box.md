---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">After the first day of Linux training, I got IP, Username and Password for a Linux box. But I really didn't know how to&nbsp;log in&nbsp;to a Linux box with Credentials. Then I asked from a few guys, unfortunately, they also didn't know what is the way to&nbsp;log in&nbsp;to Linux box.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Then I asked the guy who was next to me. How to&nbsp;log in&nbsp;to this box, then he told you to have to use putty for this. That's my first day of using putty. But I really didn't know that I'm using SSH. I'm writing this blog post because there may be people who are like me don't know how to log in to a Linux box. And&nbsp;Google&nbsp;here and there for it.</div><div><br /></div><div><ol><li>So first what you need to do is you have to download putty. For that you can&nbsp;Google&nbsp;'putty' then you can download it. Here's the link.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a></li><li>Then run it!</li><li>You will have a window like below. Enter the IP or&nbsp;hostname&nbsp;on the text box.</li></ol><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/images/putty-openssh-3.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://www.unixwiz.net/images/putty-openssh-3.gif" height="310" width="320"></a></div><div><ol start="4"><li>Then Click Open.</li><li>For the first time, they should be a long message with Yes, No Cancel Buttons.
