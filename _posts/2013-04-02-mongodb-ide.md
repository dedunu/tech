title: MongoDB IDE
---

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div align="justify">I’m using MongoDB for about 6 months. And some guys asked about an IDE. (Basically a GUI tool for MongoDB) At that time there was only one usable GUI Tool. And it is MongoVUE. It is also a painful one. So I gave it up. And now I’m used to MongoDB shell. And I can do everything in MongoDB shell. </div><div align="justify">But for Developers and QAs to get to know whether their applications are running properly, they need to check MongoDB instances. For them using MongoDB Shell is something painful.</div><div align="justify"><strong>MonjaDB</strong></div><div align="justify">But recently from MongoDB Java Developer course, I got to know about MonjaDB. MonjaDB is a plugin to an Eclipse IDE. And it is a really cool IDE. This one is available on any platform where Eclipse is available.</div><div align="justify"><a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/monjadb#.UVrrrRxHJCY" title="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/monjadb#.UVrrrRxHJCY">http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/monjadb#.UVrrrRxHJCY</a></div><div align="justify"><a href="http://www.jumperz.net/index.php?i=2&amp;a=0&amp;b=9" title="http://www.jumperz.net/index.php?i=2&amp;a=0&amp;b=9">http://www.jumperz.net/index.php?i=2&amp;a=0&amp;b=9</a></div><div align="justify"><strong>RoboMongo</strong></div><div align="justify">This one I just saw <a href="http://www.dbfriend.net/" target="_blank">one of my colleagues</a> is going to try. This one is not a plugin. And this one also an awesome tool. But only available on Macs and Windows. RoboMongo is more into DBAs side. And it supports MongoDB shell as well. And RoboMongo is a combination of a set of products. And it supports Intellisense like thing for MongoDB commands</div><div align="justify"><a href="http://www.robomongo.org/" title="http://www.robomongo.org/">http://www.robomongo.org/</a>&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">Enjoy MongoDB !!!</div></div>
